### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Pritham, a 20 year old Computer Science student currently studying at SSN College of Engineering, Chennai. I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I enjoy creating simple solutions to daily problems with computer science tools. I enjoy coding mainly in Python, but I also code in C++, Shell and Java.
